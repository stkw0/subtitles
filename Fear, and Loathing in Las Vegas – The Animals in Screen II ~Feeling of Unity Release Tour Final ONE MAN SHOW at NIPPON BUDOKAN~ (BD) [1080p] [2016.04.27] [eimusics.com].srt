1
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,896
I've found out that sound without soul cannot move people's hearts

2
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:45,552
Ah, feeling it is creepy
Your own face is jerking and being

3
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:51,809
Cunning that you don't notice
Without noticing that you are thinking worthless

4
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:57,868
Probably don't notice that you're
Lying to your world

5
00:04:57,943 --> 00:05:00,393
Your face is under layers of masks

6
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:02,825
What is (the) answer to your life?
You know?

7
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:07,902
So you let go of everything
Leaving just your mind

8
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:12,461
Let it go now, free them all
Let it go now, free them all

9
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:16,880
What's needed is your will every time
It's to be honest, yeah

10
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:20,005
Don't you stop
You take it now

11
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:26,752
Oh, tear down so many sad bonds
Only you, who can take heart in (the) back of many lies

12
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:28,932
Don't you stop
You take it now

13
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:35,962
Get away from biased viewpoints
Call in (your) belief

14
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:41,450
Lies and lies
Are piled up on my face

15
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:49,333
That's just like
Invisible shackles that hold you down
Eouh!

16
00:05:55,264 --> 00:06:03,601
Ain't nothing you've done to change
Though you wish and pray so hard

17
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,699
Do you want to change?
Do you really want to change?

18
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:13,491
What's needed is your will every time
It's to be honest, yeah (It's to be honest)

19
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:18,624
You just beat it through (beat it through)
(Yiah, yiah, yiah, yiah, yiah)

20
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:32,692
Now you all, free them
What's needed is your will every time

21
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,683
Don't you stop now
You take it now

22
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:40,111
Tear down so many sad bonds
Only you, who can take heart in (the) back of many lies

23
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,766
So, don't you stop
You take it now

24
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:50,239
Get away from biased viewpoints
Call in (your) belief

25
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:54,713
When it is time
I am going to randomly fire this sound now

26
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:57,854
The sound that will make you more brave
Tear down the restraints

27
00:06:57,954 --> 00:07:01,419
Take it out with your true smile
With your own true eyes
With your own clean hands
With your brand new heart
Release yourself right now

28
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,519
Don't stop
Gotta go

29
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:06,452
Gotta get it moving
Lose yourself (yeah)

30
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:08,688
You stand by yourself

31
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:11,688
Break your shackle
And laugh at your ease

32
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,788
When you wanna do
Eh-ra, eh-ra, eh-ra, eh, oh

33
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:15,009
Be free

34
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:16,484
With your brand new heart

35
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,977
Release it now!
Eh-ra, eh-ra, eh-ra, eh-ra, ouah

36
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,624
Find it out!

37
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:54,874
Saying what we don't even intend, I was following your lead always

38
00:07:54,974 --> 00:08:00,747
Wanting people to think I really know everything

39
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:07,687
Saying things not even close to what I intend oh yeah!

40
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,156
[Not noticing noticing the fact, realized]

41
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,892
I could not really find out (realized)

42
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:18,015
The value of, value of, value of my own life
How can I save myself? (you are) (There should be)

43
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:23,995
You are, o-oh (a sense that only you feel)
What people think and feel (Feelings)

44
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,892
Shouldn't be all the same (shouldn't be the same)

45
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:32,169
Do not stop (Do not stop to think)
To feel your will (and feel from your true feelings, yeah)

46
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:38,695
Say your straight thoughts (Put your straight thoughts and feelings)
And feelings into words (into words and action)
And go, oh (Don't you be so)

47
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:42,588
Don't be scared and just do it (and just do it)

48
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,499
Cutting out the bullshit
Fuck it up

49
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:57,268
Saying bullshit
You big Tumblebug

50
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:59,448
Cutting out the bullshit
Fuck it up

51
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:02,235
Saying bullshit
You big Tumblebug

52
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:04,451
Uh, ah (But you)

53
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:08,704
There might be some moments you (will at no doubt lose yourself and others if you)

54
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:13,631
Ah (stop to think)
Have to follow people's way out (with your true thoughts)

55
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,376
Pat it! rally, rally! such an

56
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:37,643
Pat it! rally, rally! such an

57
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:39,893
Pat it! rally, rally! such an

58
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:41,300
Pat it! rally, rally! such an

59
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,331
Won't say things outside my thoughts

60
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,262
Won't be flushed
Keep a strong will to fight yourself

61
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:48,911
Why not be yourself

62
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,559
Why not be yourself

63
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,423
Why not be yourself

64
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,437
Uh, oh!

65
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:56,537
Just know one thing

66
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,247
Don't lose yourself

67
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,274
Everything is worth it all
Saying this is for all lives

68
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:04,351
Be confident to
Have your own thoughts

69
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:07,474
And to feel and let out your feeling

70
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:13,213
Why should there be true feelings you can't say?

71
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,666
We should be

72
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,349
We should be

73
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:24,190
We should be (only what you can feel)
Yeah! (Oh!)

74
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:29,613
You can find meanings to your existence

75
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,599
You liar
Stop saying bullshit

76
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:37,368
Look at my eyes and speak
Say what you think or else, you die

77
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:40,925
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah!

78
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:44,486
Everyday will all be determined depending on your own will that no one (has)

79
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:49,235
Noticing that I'm doing (the) same things over and over daily

80
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:53,306
Get out of this loop, find the answer by yourself

81
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,228
I wonder if my own boring life will go on

82
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:00,396
I just feel everyday is so meaningless

83
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:02,151
I know I can't be like this
Walking my way home

84
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:04,193
Once again, "today" is passing by, passing by

85
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:08,812
Just like today, tomorrow will be the same and will keep being the same

86
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:16,489
Oh If you do not feel like doing anything, lets go out and get refreshed ah

87
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,494
Though you may have no goals

88
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,390
Then you wait "Alright! Come on!"

89
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:27,473
My sight has changed on the day (and) moment we (got) going on

90
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:32,111
It's not the world that changed, (its) myself that changed

91
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:37,849
I've noticed that today can be changed; its all on me

92
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:42,158
After all, nothing can be changed unless you make a change

93
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:47,193
though it may fit in any kind of cases always

94
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:55,793
Tending (to) run away, it's always my weak self that gets me

95
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,700
Let me change my weakness

96
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,148
Everyone! Right now!
Now Jump! Jump!

97
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,957
As high as you can, Now jump! jump!

98
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:22,470
No need to think!

99
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,133
The view will change once you jump and jump and jump and jump

100
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:32,704
It sure is worth to at least give it a single try! jump!

101
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:38,611
Did you see anything? Did you feel it?

102
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,087
To gain what you all want to get

103
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:54,763
Those hoping to change "The world (that) surrounds A you" or just waiting

104
00:14:54,863 --> 00:15:01,401
There are no things that will change besides you wo-o-o-uh-o

105
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:10,276
There are chances everywhere, but in (the) end, you gotta make a change wo-o

106
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:19,057
Having that in your mind, (get) to work right from this moment

107
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:25,099
Get yourself out of there now! "Get me out"

108
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,595
Stop wasting time and do it, go on forward towards your dream,

109
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:34,901
Everyday not giving up like really mad to the best of yours

110
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,132
It doesn't matter if you fail or bite the ground

111
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:42,451
Say good bye to the usual daily life

112
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:47,068
Are you all ready to get out?

113
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:50,227
Do well!

114
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:15,053
All right?
Dancing floor for you is ready

115
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:18,066
Step on a step
Don't be so shy (so shy)

116
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,061
Carry on
Carry on

117
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:24,065
Dance with us!
Wo-o-o-oh

118
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,834
Stomp hard on the beat

119
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:27,252
Let's start together

120
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:30,448
Dive into the bass drums you hear

121
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:34,295
This shit is still just a damn warm up you know, yeah!

122
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:36,190
Oh, let us get high now

123
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:40,824
Oh, let us get extremely high right now

124
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:56,582
"Damn it, damm it"
She is still not turning back to me today

125
00:16:57,132 --> 00:17:00,005
I can never be honest to myself

126
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:03,750
I'm about to give it all up after all

127
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,273
The day I was waiting for (It's the day I was waiting for)

128
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:09,373
The moment suddenly appeared

129
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:15,097
When I stood on that low stage
You were there in the front row of the crowd

130
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,840
All right
Dancing floor for you is ready

131
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,549
Step on a step

132
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:25,774
Don't be so shy (so shy)
Carry on

133
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:27,324
Carry on

134
00:17:27,424 --> 00:17:29,424
Dance with us!
Wo-o-o-oh

135
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:31,646
Stomp hard on the beat

136
00:17:31,705 --> 00:17:33,019
Let's start together

137
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,355
I just want to see your biggest smile

138
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,247
Might seem like a dream but it ain't
It is here, yeah!

139
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,394
There are people inside (you just can't deal with)

140
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,671
So it ain't easy to gather hearts to one

141
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:02,445
Ah!

142
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:04,545
Fighting since monkeys

143
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:07,545
And probably will be the same now on

144
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,645
Still fighting just like the ancient days

145
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:12,725
We are still fighting from ages ago

146
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:29,872
Ah, ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta

147
00:18:29,972 --> 00:18:31,972
But here, there is a drip of hope

148
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:34,072
We-we-we-we, we-we-weh

149
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:37,139
Making big noise
And we come along with the flow of the noise

150
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:40,497
And we can become one
There is a small little hope

151
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:43,360
La-la-la-la, la-la-lah

152
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:47,346
"Dance tune it is"

153
00:18:55,107 --> 00:19:00,840
We have been hitting the floor from the days we were born

154
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,565
Sound will keep changing
But what we do won't change

155
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:12,579
We have been hitting the floor from when we were born (It's all the same)

156
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:19,191
It's all the same since we were apes (since we were apes)

157
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:44,974
Inside my drawer
There was an old photo

158
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,443
Album with myself all tanned up

159
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:52,024
Pulling an all nighter, saying
"Going to bed is a waste of time"

160
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,253
At no time, was time enough for me to do all

161
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:57,129
Here and there, doing this and that

162
00:19:57,189 --> 00:20:01,834
I was always looking towards the days coming along (to the days coming along)

163
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:08,607
Are you not shooting out your lips with a shit like face now?

164
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,913
Wooh oh-oh-oh-oh!
It must be hot

165
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:16,282
The backs of those dreaming guys

166
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:18,751
Do you just want to step back?

167
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:23,389
Wooh oh-oh-oh-oh!
Words are not needed

168
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:25,825
Faces tell the story

169
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:29,495
Just keep running for yourself and life

170
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:33,132
Here we go it's game time

171
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:35,367
To fight with all our strengths

172
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,271
Swing your arms hard with all that you have

173
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,883
Wow oh, oh-oh-oh-oh yeah!

174
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:54,053
The summer party does not end

175
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:58,050
Age, gender, and all that do not matter

176
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,828
Wow oh, oh-oh-oh-oh yeah!

177
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:05,911
So let us all have a blast

178
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:12,210
And let us spend days like going crazy from now on

179
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:45,542
Summer is filled with innocence
Shaking your neck

180
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,731
To the sound of waves

181
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,791
Dive into this season

182
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:54,113
Not doing anything soullessly
Spending idle days

183
00:21:55,168 --> 00:21:59,949
Bit by bit damping down
Reach your hands out

184
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,056
Check out those fire works up there

185
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:11,709
Let's rise up high just like those fireworks
(Just like those fireworks)

186
00:22:11,783 --> 00:22:15,501
Let this heat break up all the upcoming sadness

187
00:22:15,561 --> 00:22:18,971
Let us all get high! Hey!
Let's get high! Hey!

188
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:21,767
Don't you feel it all coming to you?

189
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:25,244
Let this heat break up all (the) unwillingness

190
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:28,514
Let us all get high! Hey!
Let's get high! Hey!

191
00:22:28,574 --> 00:22:31,651
Don't you feel it all coming to you?

192
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:40,109
Wooh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Wooh, oh-oh-oh-oh

193
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:42,673
There you go now

194
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,265
Shout till you are feeling hot and fall forward

195
00:22:46,189 --> 00:22:50,698
Run like mad

196
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:55,439
Gotta jump
Go Insane

197
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:14,179
You guys do not notice that we

198
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:17,504
Are gifted just by being humans

199
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:20,819
We are absolute predators

200
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:24,923
We do not even have any enemies

201
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:28,903
Maybe there are other animals watching us

202
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:37,970
And thinking that someday "we will beat them down"

203
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,277
Oh we have the brains to think hard

204
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:47,906
Wear our favorite clothes

205
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:51,862
We are at no doubt human beings

206
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,723
Many small lives
They were born

207
00:25:54,782 --> 00:25:56,196
with the fate

208
00:25:56,242 --> 00:25:58,242
of dying for someone

209
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,190
A human baby

210
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,054
When will they find out

211
00:26:04,114 --> 00:26:07,946
That at the point they were born, we are

212
00:26:08,006 --> 00:26:11,103
(The) winners of Earth

213
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:21,444
"Hey, why are you crying?" I ask you, next to me

214
00:26:21,504 --> 00:26:30,894
That's why we live so close together, until we shine
For what have I been living for?

215
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:34,468
When will I find out the answer? 
An answer that is only for you

216
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:39,952
What will myself and (the) first scenery I saw

217
00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:47,184
Look like? 
It's my face, my face

218
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:50,282
Shut up!

219
00:26:50,406 --> 00:26:52,406
I read this inside the book I read before

220
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:54,466
[The book I read before] 
According (to) Maslow

221
00:26:54,475 --> 00:26:56,199
[According (to) Maslow]

222
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:59,284
There are five steps (in a) human's desire

223
00:26:59,344 --> 00:27:02,198
To live a long life to stay safe and to receive

224
00:27:02,258 --> 00:27:04,973
[Baby] 
love from others

225
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:07,033
To get respect from 
[Baby]

226
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:09,093
other, To get closer 
[Yeah]

227
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:11,153
to your ideal 
[Yeah]

228
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,761
That's what it said 
[Yeah]

229
00:27:12,821 --> 00:27:15,633
No matter how hard other animals try

230
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:19,860
they probably can't go over the first step

231
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,484
That is how intelligent we are and, (an animal) filled with greed

232
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:37,523
But that is probably why we can still live on top of the food chain

233
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:40,264
in this blue planet although we have weak bodies

234
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:52,905
Ah, the usual morning reflected in your eyes

235
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:59,221
Is disappearing in the tears flowing from them

236
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:05,832
For what to live for 
Think deeply as you live yeah

237
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:13,956
Cuz humans are (the) only ones that can do this on Earth 
Your new answer,

238
00:28:16,702 --> 00:28:22,848
What is it that you want to get in your right hands? 
Let me hear

239
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,290
Tell me your new answer 
Prove that you are different from monkeys

240
00:28:25,391 --> 00:28:27,936
If there is nothing to crave for, humans will die in a way

241
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:36,932
Don't you think so too? 
Let me hear, Let me hear, Let me hear

242
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:56,486
I'm living (the) same boring shit everyday

243
00:29:56,666 --> 00:30:02,701
Do you really think this is how you want?

244
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:09,241
We're all here 'cause we know what's fun and not

245
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,784
You don't know anything so
Here we go!

246
00:30:12,994 --> 00:30:16,032
Don't you dare give up!

247
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:32,864
I got dumped the other day by my girl

248
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:39,858
But today I'll teach you all (the) fun stuff!

249
00:30:40,702 --> 00:30:45,977
Change this floor to a dancing hall, boys and girls!

250
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:51,971
Dance and make some noise!
Forget about everything!

251
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:55,618
Get fucked up (and) scream out with me!

252
00:30:55,761 --> 00:30:58,605
Wo-o-o!
Wo-o-o!

253
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:03,762
Don't miss it!
(This) time is yours!

254
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:08,133
You guys ready?
Scream your ass out!

255
00:31:08,193 --> 00:31:10,589
Wo-o-o!
Wo-o-o!

256
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:16,114
I'll burst your brain in pieces

257
00:31:17,197 --> 00:31:19,945
Close your eyes

258
00:31:20,632 --> 00:31:23,482
Shake your fuckin' head

259
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:26,351
Don't think of anything

260
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:28,952
Emancipate

261
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:35,727
The best moment tend to pass by quickly

262
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:41,934
That is how life is, life is, waah!

263
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:00,886
Get fucked up (and) scream out with me!!

264
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:03,862
Wo-o-o!
Wo-o-o!

265
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:09,227
Don't miss it!
(This) time is yours!

266
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:13,432
You guys ready?
Scream your ass out!

267
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:15,967
Wo-o-o!
Wo-o-o!

268
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:23,014
I'll burst your brain in pieces
Wo-o-o!

269
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:27,795
Uh, uh, uh

270
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:30,600
Looking through the sky (out the) window
Watching the flying birds, I felt jealous

271
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:33,286
When I saw (the) wet bird on (a) rainy day,
I felt a bit sorry

272
00:35:33,346 --> 00:35:35,346
I admire (the good people)
Because I'm...

273
00:35:35,412 --> 00:35:39,247
Diffident diffident diffident diffident
Check it out now yo

274
00:35:55,036 --> 00:35:59,040
Regretting it turned out like this

275
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:16,625
Stop it Matching yourself with anyone

276
00:36:16,835 --> 00:36:21,295
It's really silly
So you should have confidence

277
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:23,358
Oh You are yourself

278
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:27,686
Facing what only you can do and think

279
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:31,456
Go and do it right now

280
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:43,031
Age that everything is things is set, though we are in a blessed environment, some people aren't able to do things

281
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:45,172
(A) world with too much information

282
00:36:45,343 --> 00:36:48,496
It seems hard to show your real self

283
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:56,089
Light up your own mind

284
00:36:56,149 --> 00:37:00,685
Find your unique self that you

285
00:37:00,745 --> 00:37:10,788
Oh raised up
Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi

286
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,101
Now are you ready to jump into the world with confidence and eagerness!? Yeah!

287
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:26,854
当て所なく歩いた夜も 今の僕を支えている

288
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,718
I've started to see the real world

289
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:35,265
And all my dreams became a goal to me ah

290
00:37:35,485 --> 00:37:40,763
Let us be
(Be able to able to have courage

291
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:55,229
A talent can't talent can't be achieved without any effort
No such thing as a perfect a person exists in this world)
Why not take a chance of yours

292
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:25,937
It is almost two point five decades since I was born

293
00:38:25,997 --> 00:38:31,240
I've had so many of jellos so far
And how many more will I swallow from now on?

294
00:38:31,313 --> 00:38:34,458
I've already taken tons of exams

295
00:38:34,518 --> 00:38:40,227
And what else is coming up to me from now on?
Daily lives must pass by quickly without any "likes" and "hates"

296
00:38:40,287 --> 00:38:44,622
That girl who falls for guys easily
Fell for another one then another one and another one each time

297
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:49,744
For a guy without such experience
Everyday life now is like a stormy river

298
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:51,366
So fast!

299
00:38:54,426 --> 00:38:55,459
Break out!

300
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:04,767
I sing to myself before I get sunk

301
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:11,546
I jumped out to stop the streaming days
The coastline (Shore line I ran)

302
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,392
I ran on that strong sunny day (strong sunny day)

303
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:24,257
If you wanna take back that feeling (take back that feeling)
That feeling and give it a deep color of your own self

304
00:39:24,317 --> 00:39:27,067
First, smash down that door, yeah

305
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:31,093
Ah, that guy sitting in the window seat is smart

306
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:35,676
And that guy two seats away from me
Has such a great sense of humor

307
00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:39,386
And that guy I don't like so much even has good parts

308
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:44,350
Everyone is calling you too
Just like the others

309
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:17,448
Just play them out so loud
All those CDs in your room

310
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:22,186
Have become not attracted to the nostalgic ones

311
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:32,089
Reshoot those dots
Make yourself into a straight line

312
00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:41,937
On such nights
Have some of your favored

313
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:50,122
Just trace them
And next reshoot

314
00:41:04,017 --> 00:41:06,217
Tonight, the thunder knocks on your heart

315
00:41:06,345 --> 00:41:12,968
Run hard
And you never know (you never know)
You never know
Never (When the storm)

316
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:14,514
When the storm
Will come to you

317
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:19,625
Be strong before
That day (arrives)
Thunder arrives to you (The thunder knocks)

318
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:27,008
The thunder knocks on your heart
Complete your original sketch of dots
Before that day comes (That day arrives to you)

319
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:29,613
Aaah (Pon-po-pon-pon-po-pon)

320
00:41:29,673 --> 00:41:41,791
The thunder knocks on your heart
Run hard (When that day comes to you, run hard)
Before that day comes to you ah

321
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:50,619
Do you think you're gonna be ok tonight?
Ah, feeling awfully lonely, falling down

322
00:43:50,665 --> 00:43:57,669
Oh, thinking what will happen if I'm (the) only one
All alone here in this world

323
00:44:40,942 --> 00:44:48,658
Maybe talking to be free, oh want to be
Uh, alone often recently feeling this

324
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:55,917
I'm falling down on my own in a muted room as
My lonely feelings keep growing

325
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:20,851
Everything has meanings for us
And today, I am standing here (By)

326
00:45:20,862 --> 00:45:30,513
And thinking that I am living on my own (his own; I was thinking I was living on my own)
Somehow, oh (A world without anybody does not exist here)

327
00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:34,498
We sure do feel you all
Calling to hear you all

328
00:45:34,558 --> 00:45:40,079
In this life I've lived so far
I saw no meaningless encounters

329
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:45,243
I want to reconfirm my feelings
Can you feel it now?

330
00:45:45,303 --> 00:45:50,114
Tell me your own way
For now and (the) future

331
00:45:50,174 --> 00:45:54,919
Before my sad daily life
All change into the

332
00:45:54,979 --> 00:46:00,640
All change into the lame old days, wo-oh

333
00:46:12,698 --> 00:46:26,940
And you o-o-oh
And you o-o-oh

334
00:46:28,895 --> 00:46:38,120
To "Keep holding appreciation of" (We want to tell you all)
Thinking that is what's needed (Being grateful for you)

335
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:44,260
We tend to forget once in a while (At always keep having our gratitude to people)
But shouldn't forget (Gratitude to people)

336
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,976
That is what's important (supporting me; feeling that's what's important)
For a person to live (Though we tend to forget at times)

337
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:54,152
There is something I wanna tell you all (Always got to remember its one of the things we need to live)
Even now, here, oh (Eh!)

338
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:59,880
In front of us, we can see
So many people being in our lives

339
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,940
Like this, keeping us one

340
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,823
You don't have be so down (Pya!)
You don't have be so down (Pya!)

341
00:47:05,883 --> 00:47:10,409
Can't live alone
That is why we are living

342
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:17,301
And sharing the same world here
"Existing to link and bond"

343
00:47:17,361 --> 00:47:21,346
You, don't bring 'em so down (Pya!)
You, don't bring 'em so down (Pya!)

344
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:23,269
Why not come out with us?

345
00:47:23,316 --> 00:47:25,100
We want you all to remember
When you feel down

346
00:47:25,161 --> 00:47:29,191
When you've lost yourself
When you are worried about thing

347
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:33,966
When you feel sad
"You are not (the) only one"

348
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:53,243
Now and forever

349
00:51:53,303 --> 00:51:57,977
Middle of the journey
Beautiful scene
Terrible scene

350
00:51:58,037 --> 00:52:02,742
More and more sights we want to see

351
00:52:02,802 --> 00:52:09,393
The place we are heading to
And lots more we wanna do

352
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:18,619
And at the same time we have
The same amount of worries

353
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:24,071
But are madly into it that we don't feel them

354
00:52:24,131 --> 00:52:30,681
We will keep on moving on and aim high, oh

355
00:52:30,959 --> 00:52:39,358
Our lives will not end up as just a story, oh oh

356
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:45,366
Not stopping to walk
Until we get them in our hands

357
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:49,667
Extending our own chances, goal and dream

358
00:52:49,786 --> 00:52:58,776
We want to go over borders
We can get to the end

359
00:52:59,386 --> 00:53:01,952
Gonna really make it come a true one

360
00:53:02,029 --> 00:53:07,071
What people never imagined till now

361
00:53:07,131 --> 00:53:13,507
Gonna make it come true
Nah see you
Nah see you

362
00:53:14,113 --> 00:53:18,186
Past walls that we have faced

363
00:53:18,246 --> 00:53:21,699
Gonna really make it come true

364
00:53:21,759 --> 00:53:32,741
What people never imagined till now
Gonna make it come true, yeah!

365
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:40,451
Nothing to say
The daily cycle of heading

366
00:53:40,511 --> 00:53:47,010
To our imaged scene (If you have the strong will to get)
If you have the strong will (to the goal to achieve them)

367
00:53:47,085 --> 00:53:51,580
All I can see are big fat walls and my missing factors

368
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,799
All I (There may be times we feel like breaking down)

369
00:53:54,859 --> 00:53:57,517
It doesn't matter if it is time taking

370
00:53:57,592 --> 00:54:01,798
All you have to do is to have the strong will (It doesn't matter if it takes time)

371
00:54:01,895 --> 00:54:08,133
Strong will (All you have to do is to have the strong will)

372
00:54:08,262 --> 00:54:18,088
What we like and want to do
Not missing this chance, oh oh

373
00:54:18,148 --> 00:54:22,784
Holding it tight
We are going to live a great life

374
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:29,166
We are gonna do it
That is why I'm asking you

375
00:54:29,226 --> 00:54:39,928
Asking you (asking you)
Asking you (asking you)
Asking you, oh

376
00:55:04,172 --> 00:55:07,641
Heading towards our "Ideal selves"

377
00:55:07,701 --> 00:55:14,863
Moving towards each goal
Moving to the next when it is achieved (So just keep)

378
00:55:14,923 --> 00:55:19,704
As there is, ah (So just keep on looking)
An ending to a story (and moving forward now)

379
00:55:19,764 --> 00:55:25,077
When an ending comes
(Another) start shows up, oh (There should be a beautiful)

380
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:30,316
Oh, let us get over (scenery waiting for us)
To the rear end now, oh (rear end now, oh)

381
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:43,073
Closely listen to the voice and heart beat

382
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,090
Now the beating has stopped can’t hear a thing
Pieces has fell apart

383
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:09,169
The world we live today is filled with gloom and tears

384
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:14,429
But what we only can do is to sigh and site alone in the dark

385
00:56:14,606 --> 00:56:18,041
Life filled with vanity
Colors have faded

386
00:56:18,101 --> 00:56:21,110
Things you desire exist here

387
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:28,711
Flee from this colorless world
Back in the days everything had shined so bright

388
00:56:28,771 --> 00:56:34,432
We didn’t have to carry fear towards future
Dreams colored (and) lit our mind with hope

389
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:41,276
The sound of heart we shared
Beats in my memory unchanged from back then

390
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:46,000
Can you hear me sing?
Don’t you be fall in down

391
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:48,736
Oh, my Lord, it’s gone
What should I do?

392
00:56:48,796 --> 00:56:51,068
Pieces I had
Have fell apart

393
00:56:51,128 --> 00:56:53,331
Where do you belong?
Where should I aim (for)?

394
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:56,271
Once you’ve lost sight
It’s left to fall apart

395
00:57:09,019 --> 00:57:12,293
Let’s start it over again

396
00:57:12,353 --> 00:57:15,276
Rebuild and combine all the pieces we have lost

397
00:57:15,336 --> 00:57:17,719
To become one
Like a puzzle

398
00:57:17,779 --> 00:57:20,223
Take it one at a time

399
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:32,532
When I stopped a rusted chain tangled me up

400
00:57:32,592 --> 00:57:34,875
Tying my body onto the ground

401
00:57:34,935 --> 00:57:37,332
As I sink underground I call your name

402
00:57:37,392 --> 00:57:41,805
What can I do to see the day light once more?
Tear it apart and rip it off

403
00:57:41,865 --> 00:57:43,865
Break the chain now
Sink down or swim up

404
00:57:43,925 --> 00:57:45,226
Fight your way through

405
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:50,728
Seek your way out
If you can not, you are left to drown deep inside
Chain tangled me harder, choking my neck

406
00:58:00,864 --> 00:58:03,496
You who knew all my weakness is gone

407
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:05,850
Can you come back and stay by my side

408
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:11,557
I’ll be standing here waiting you

409
00:58:12,477 --> 00:58:18,079
Heart newly born is always strong and brave

410
00:58:18,139 --> 00:58:23,854
No matter how steep the road we take
It can drive us forever and ever
Let’s take it how we want

411
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:33,998
The choice we make is (for you) and my future
Can you hear me sing?

412
00:58:45,686 --> 00:58:47,842
Misery is nothing

413
00:58:47,902 --> 00:58:50,139
It is all up to your thoughts and beliefs

414
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:54,815
To bring in success within your life
Don't you compare yourself with other people

415
00:58:54,889 --> 00:59:00,967
That's a waste of person you are, so why not be honest to your emotion?

416
00:59:01,047 --> 00:59:02,404
Don’t you be falling down

417
00:59:02,464 --> 00:59:06,879
All the promises made between us
Broke in pieces and turned into sand

418
00:59:06,939 --> 00:59:12,599
Let's escape from this colorless world to find myself
And tomorrow that we live

419
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:07,989
I have never gone through such a big love
That you see in movies but

420
01:00:08,049 --> 01:00:11,402
Have been betrayed
And even had beef with people

421
01:00:11,462 --> 01:00:17,538
I had times that I was about to break down
But I found it, "only one"

422
01:00:18,188 --> 01:00:23,968
"Youngness" can't be bought
Even if a billionaire puts down a pile of bills

423
01:00:24,028 --> 01:00:30,447
When a young kid is still a young kid
Being able to meet you gets me excited

424
01:00:30,507 --> 01:00:36,289
Fall into the sky
Oh, gonna dance with you

425
01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:43,073
Taking your hand
Eye to eye
Conveying my love to you, oh oh

426
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:46,013
Fall into the sky

427
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:51,214
Oh, making you laugh and cry
So telling you my feelings

428
01:00:51,274 --> 01:00:56,931
Hoping you will be mine forever
Won't let you go

429
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:08,031
Why are you crying now?

430
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:11,701
I cannot understand

431
01:01:11,761 --> 01:01:18,621
Oh tell me why, my love
What is making you so sad

432
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:22,746
Why are you crying now?

433
01:01:22,806 --> 01:01:32,689
Those clear tears will wash my "today" far away
Makes me feel I can't come back

434
01:01:32,749 --> 01:01:36,621
(Wow Wow Wow)
The sound that hits your heart

435
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:41,597
(Wow Wow Wow)
The words (that) hit you deep in your heart

436
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:48,004
Beat it now
We wanna dance with you now

437
01:01:48,064 --> 01:01:54,620
The sound that hits your heart
The words that hit your heart

438
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,781
Beat it now (beat it now, beat it now)
Hey you all

439
01:01:57,841 --> 01:02:03,186
Let's jump to the night sky, night sky, night sky (night sky)

440
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,923
I still remember in my heart

441
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:10,876
The first smile you showed me
Sure sure sure it was beautiful

442
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:15,477
I don't know how many times
I was saved by your smile

443
01:02:15,537 --> 01:02:18,832
Will keep holding your hand

444
01:02:18,892 --> 01:02:22,815
So just dance tonight (Still remember deep in my heart, the first smile you showed)

445
01:02:22,147 --> 01:02:30,090
So just dance tonight (I don't know how many times I was saved by your smile)
I will keep loving you and keep talking to you (Just dance)

446
01:02:30,095 --> 01:02:35,109
From my heart until the end, yeah (until the end)

447
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,929
So hey you
Here comes the end
The last scene

448
01:02:40,005 --> 01:02:42,792
As I said
I'm not in love like what you see in movie

449
01:02:42,852 --> 01:02:47,599
But to me, your love is movie like
Actually, you are the protagonist, yeah

450
01:02:47,647 --> 01:02:55,873
Hee, hoo, hee, hoo, hee
Uuuh (Oaagh) (Oooh)
Remember

451
01:03:34,078 --> 01:03:40,973
You'll have your feet carried off oh

452
01:03:41,152 --> 01:03:50,293
It is aiming you from the bottom of darkness

453
01:03:55,334 --> 01:03:59,073
Out fine as it always
A sense of worry hits you now

454
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:08,111
If it's gonna turn out a you wish
Was it turning out so good at first?

455
01:04:08,116 --> 01:04:13,650
No! If you were more careful then, maybe things were different by now

456
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:16,561
Hey, were there things you could have done?

457
01:04:16,689 --> 01:04:24,160
Don't you be satisfied and push your own luck
Cuz you don't want to sorrow

458
01:04:27,212 --> 01:04:34,371
The hands of the demon could be just around the corner

459
01:04:34,868 --> 01:04:41,578
What will (I) be like 10 years later
Oh Will it turn out just as I want?

460
01:04:41,638 --> 01:04:46,216
Going on so oh
Do the things we want we are glad

461
01:04:46,276 --> 01:04:55,596
But it might all end once you get off track
So we have to keep fighting yeah

462
01:04:55,684 --> 01:05:01,264
Oh everyday, everyday, ah (in) order to keep up this path oh

463
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:20,316
It's pointless to be depressed
So hear your voice wo-o-o

464
01:05:20,376 --> 01:05:25,805
Don't you be tired Still not enough
So you say wo-o-o

465
01:05:25,865 --> 01:05:30,461
It's important to keep facing and moving forward from now

466
01:05:30,448 --> 01:05:36,232
Never, never, never, never
You will succeed if you keep holding your strong will

467
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:40,256
Don't you be tired still not enough

468
01:05:48,733 --> 01:05:58,321
Cuz you don't wanna sorrow.
There are numbers of people that want to kick you off from just right there

469
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:07,931
Ah (The) lose everything all of your stuff, all of your stuff That is what can hit you in no time

470
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:16,139
Ah To not end up like that, we have to carefully move on now ah

471
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:18,199
Slacking yourself off could rot you

472
01:06:18,259 --> 01:06:21,920
(You) must not forget that fear if you have a dream that you want to achieve and a place you wanna get to

473
01:06:21,925 --> 01:06:27,040
Always watch your backs for the dark
They are always watching you

474
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,782
Aiming for chance to grab your feet

475
01:06:29,842 --> 01:06:38,475
Once they get you, you can never come back
Kicked down

476
01:06:38,913 --> 01:06:43,870
You sure wanna end up like this?

477
01:07:24,345 --> 01:07:26,500
Short but seems long

478
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,330
Time of our life

479
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:32,095
What can and will you do in the remaining time

480
01:07:32,605 --> 01:07:39,200
Ah!
Every life of all species aren't eternal

481
01:07:39,326 --> 01:07:43,226
Tick-Tick-Tock
The clock is moving each and every second

482
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:46,837
Tick-Tick-Tock
Gradually heading to the epilogue

483
01:07:46,975 --> 01:07:52,845
Tick-Tick-Tock
Someday, we will have to face the end of story
Wo-oh

484
01:07:56,490 --> 01:08:04,013
With not knowing how to stop
The second hand will just keep running

485
01:08:04,073 --> 01:08:11,621
Like a sandglass that won't flip
We never can take our steps backwards

486
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:19,495
Living days twenty-four-seven
Without knowing when our life will come to end

487
01:08:19,555 --> 01:08:31,174
But let's just smile with joy
Time keeps flying
Ah!

488
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:57,333
We ain't got so long to go
Only a few moment left!

489
01:08:57,662 --> 01:09:04,573
Say if everyday was 48 hours
There would have been more things
We could have done

490
01:09:04,633 --> 01:09:09,057
If our life span was twice as long
There would have been more smiles

491
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:12,593
And laughter throughout the globe
But clock will tick and gonna not stop

492
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:16,315
Can you hear the clock ticking
Right inside your chest

493
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:23,960
Time is life so spend your days the way you want
We have got one shot as who we are now so

494
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:27,430
Live days with laughter

495
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:33,928
Lived a day safely basically means
You've got a day closer to death

496
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:37,679
What goes around comes around
Like life goes reincarnation

497
01:09:37,725 --> 01:09:41,421
Wishing that this moment will last forever is something natural

498
01:09:41,451 --> 01:09:46,382
But unfortunately eternity does not exist for any human

499
01:09:46,442 --> 01:09:52,955
We tend to think back of all
The precious memories

500
01:09:53,366 --> 01:09:58,645
But clocks never wind back its hand!

501
01:10:00,505 --> 01:10:04,326
We all carry fear inside
A fear that this moment

502
01:10:04,386 --> 01:10:08,171
Will reach the end
But don't you cry for now

503
01:10:08,231 --> 01:10:11,829
Though it might be scared
As long as we are alive

504
01:10:11,889 --> 01:10:16,205
We can always come back

505
01:10:17,701 --> 01:10:32,628
Sun arise from the east sky again
And alarms beside the bed rings to wake us up

506
01:10:33,915 --> 01:10:41,504
Time may be flying mercilessly
Leaving and won't let nobody catch-up

507
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:48,026
But it is not about rushing
It's how you live and deal with your time

508
01:10:48,086 --> 01:10:55,654
Living days twenty-four-seven
Without knowing when our life will come to end

509
01:10:55,714 --> 01:11:05,972
But let's just smile with joy
Time keeps flying

510
01:14:36,103 --> 01:14:41,177
Ah!
Chase the light!

511
01:14:45,152 --> 01:14:51,012
I reached out but I have not arrived yet
I dislike nightly opinions

512
01:14:51,290 --> 01:15:01,919
An impulse to make a convinient excuse
(From) time to time,
I feel like running away

513
01:15:01,975 --> 01:15:05,935
Trying to face away
from this situation

514
01:15:05,995 --> 01:15:11,067
But for me to live
I have to decide my own way

515
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:13,771
Take it easy
It's gonna be alright

516
01:15:13,947 --> 01:15:16,370
Have faith and
trust what a person you are

517
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:18,881
In times when you feel lost
believe yourself

518
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:21,200
Overcome all the enemies

519
01:15:25,128 --> 01:15:26,570
Are you ready? Let's go!!

520
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:29,358
Chill out
and be easygoing sometimes

521
01:15:29,418 --> 01:15:31,917
That was what you've
told me in bad times

522
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:39,568
Because I want to laugh when I was about to get entagled

523
01:15:39,628 --> 01:15:47,076
Also check daily days
I can not find it but I will keep my eyes away

524
01:15:47,136 --> 01:15:54,417
I can do it
Stretch out your hand

525
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:19,249
Fog hanged over

526
01:16:19,309 --> 01:16:26,882
Making me blind(Making me blind)
I cut through the air
with my hand

527
01:16:26,942 --> 01:16:32,270
And then I realized
I ran into a wonderland
filled with mysteries

528
01:16:32,424 --> 01:16:34,837
I knew if I kept
running without stopping

529
01:16:34,907 --> 01:16:39,890
I will someday find the way
out from here

530
01:16:51,592 --> 01:16:54,872
Take a look around

531
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:10,897
Each one of us shares
different thoughts and features

532
01:17:10,957 --> 01:17:19,768
No one is the same
and that's what makes us
the only special

533
01:17:24,028 --> 01:17:30,246
Spring has arrived
Season of new life has come

534
01:17:30,306 --> 01:17:36,654
So transparent and dazzling to tomorrow

535
01:17:36,671 --> 01:17:43,410
We all face and go
through tough moments

536
01:17:43,538 --> 01:17:49,899
But with the help of others
we gain the power to
stand up again

537
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:45,754
Why we standing here ?
In such lonely world filled with silence

538
01:18:46,345 --> 01:18:58,267
Why is world so cold ?
We're iced on the ground can't move

539
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:08,450
Now it is time for me to carry out the promise
The light of hope suddenly shined

540
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:15,751
We feel the power flowing through us
Why are we so scared ?

541
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:30,699
We're not alone
Free your emotions and scream from your heart
It rouses now feel that you're alive

542
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:55,866
Sorry to have you waiting for so long
Would this feeling reach your heart ?

543
01:19:58,097 --> 01:20:04,733
Our heart has been united as one
No one can stop us
This is our destiny

544
01:20:04,793 --> 01:20:11,840
We feel the power flowing through us
Why are we so scared ?

545
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:27,498
We're not alone
Free your emotions and scream from your heart
It rouses now feel that you're alive

546
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:25,671
Shake it down
We have confidence to make
You guys guys you guys enjoy

547
01:21:25,731 --> 01:21:29,915
For this day, we have worked so hard
Nobody can stop
No one can stop us

548
01:21:29,975 --> 01:21:33,159
We are gonna make you
All say (we) are the number one! ah!

So we're gonna do it

579
01:23:45,941 --> 01:23:49,591
We are gonna become the
Only one

Don't know what's being misunderstood

590
01:27:07,078 --> 01:27:10,125
Missiles flying
Children getting shot

591
01:27:10,185 --> 01:27:12,378
Swindles everywhere

592
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:16,832
People who should be
The most loved ones
Killing each other

593
01:27:16,892 --> 01:27:23,705
Once you keep an eye off
Things get stolen

594
01:27:23,765 --> 01:27:26,775
The world is like this
The world we don't know
The unknown world

595
01:27:26,835 --> 01:27:28,549
Out of our hands
It don't matter

596
01:27:28,609 --> 01:27:30,377
Covering it up
Acting like you don't see a thing

597
01:27:30,437 --> 01:27:33,497
If you think it's a defferent thing
You won't notice that the world

598
01:27:33,525 --> 01:27:37,420
You live in is eventually hitting towards this matter

599
01:27:39,321 --> 01:27:46,595
Look at it!
Oh, yeah!
The world is all linked together

600
01:27:46,655 --> 01:27:53,487
Save our loved ones and the world (Hey! hey! Because breaking)
These peaceful days lasting is a wish (down the piled wood castle is easy)

601
01:27:53,479 --> 01:28:00,345
Because I have no idea (Hey! hey! These peaceful days)
How many tickets "to live today" are (left) (continuing is just like a wish)

602
01:28:00,405 --> 01:28:13,469
Even at the time when you were playing cards
Somewhere in the world
Somebody is crying ah (ah, ah)

603
01:28:18,952 --> 01:28:20,733
Us to one

604
01:28:24,623 --> 01:28:31,206
Let me hear your voice!
Oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi!

605
01:28:31,266 --> 01:28:40,015
Cmon, Cmon!
Oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi!
Oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi!

606
01:28:45,301 --> 01:28:49,516
Ah, eah!

607
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:02,304
We all have weaknesses
Losing against it is the end

608
01:29:02,364 --> 01:29:08,844
Don't limit yourself
Got to change them, ah!
(Got to change them)

609
01:29:08,904 --> 01:29:14,779
Raise your voice
To fight it out against your weak self
(We sure do gotta change theme, uh)

610
01:29:15,017 --> 01:29:16,621
We sure do gotta change theme

611
01:29:16,681 --> 01:29:20,325
The raising worries
The falling cold sweats on the back (on the back)

612
01:29:20,385 --> 01:29:23,388
Backing off saying
"Can not make it happen" (Breakin' down)

613
01:29:23,448 --> 01:29:26,676
You really think (that way)?
You really think (that way)?

614
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:30,188
Shake it off and move on (Come on!)
Shake it off and move on

615
01:29:30,248 --> 01:29:35,780
just you are my love
Your pure feeling (You are my love, your faithful eyes)
That beautiful voice 

616
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:38,114
It's so valuable (That beautiful voice It's precious)

617
01:29:38,174 --> 01:29:44,102
I wanna stay with you
Not only tonight (I want to stay with you, not only tonight but from now on)

618
01:29:44,162 --> 01:29:55,190
The words that fell from you (The words that fell from your voice)
Let us change it to connect tomorrow (Change it to connect tomorrow)
Let's sing until our voices die (eh)

619
01:29:54,923 --> 01:30:03,689
There must be many walls
There must be times you will be breaking down
But this song is there for you

620
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:19,774
There is one thing to tell you all;
Listening to this lively song
