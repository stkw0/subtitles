1
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:06,893
A person that can't think and do
I'm not one of them, no I ain't
I'm not one of them, no I ain't

2
00:05:06,977 --> 00:05:09,103
I was totally wrong, yeah
Stop thinking

3
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:11,276
I'm right, yes I am
Stop thinking
I'm right, yes I am

4
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,148
Think over as if you are possessed by something

5
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:35,883
I thought I had it
But I was wrong man
I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere

6
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:42,042
So I was wrong man
A person that can't think and do
I'm not one of them, no I ain't
I'm not one of them, no I ain't

7
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:46,160
I was totally wrong, yeah
Stop thinking
I'm right, yes I am
Stop thinking
I'm right, yes I am

8
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,122
Think again carefully
As if you are haunted

9
00:05:49,182 --> 00:06:00,700
I thought, I thought I could do it
Is it too late now?

10
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:12,280
Ah
Reality tells that myself now can not do anything
I can't do anything

11
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,385
Ah
But I wanna get off to a start

12
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:24,963
Just gotta take yourself in and move on
I want to make a start

13
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,035
Pa-pah

14
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:11,927
It isn't easy to take in yourself that can not do anything

15
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:18,661
Have faith to make the right decision, you moron

16
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:33,234
Ah, Now is the start line
Take in your shitty self along with your tears on your face

17
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:45,571
There are visions you can see once you begin a new start
There are things you can do once you start new

18
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,742
Get down to zero, right now
Accept your inability

19
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,572
Take down your past self
Do you have the guts?

20
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:54,570
Get down to zero, right now
Accept your inability

21
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,651
Take down your past self
Do you have the guts to restart again?

22
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,326
What's going on?
How is your face after being crushed down by regret

23
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:56,087
You were living everyday without knowing, oh

24
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:58,758
How does it feel
How does it feel

25
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:03,994
How does it feel
When you believed you were the center of the world

26
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:17,621
Before I fail
Before I fail
Before I fail

27
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:25,407
Before I fail
I asked to myself (oh) (myself)

28
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:32,328
Look back to what you have done and think (look back)
Are you gonna stay (you stay)
As a person who lost heart (who lost heart for others?)

29
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:36,772
So many hearts in this world that could give you hope

30
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:39,004
So many thoughts
So many feels

31
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:45,507
You can see it and you know it
But you don't notice it and feel it
That is why

32
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:52,456
You are about to end up being alone here

33
00:09:57,374 --> 00:10:02,521
What's going on?
How is your face after being crushed down by regret

34
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:07,263
How does it feel when you've ignored everyone's thought (oh)

35
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,738
Yeah, alright nobody is here not a single person
I've lost it all myself, oh

36
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:26,771
I did lie, I did lie but
Never knew it was this tough and lonely!

37
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:30,386
Hey it's show time (Here we go now)
Music in the woods (Music echoes)

38
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:35,226
Deers, bears, and birds getting (together giving each other respect)
Hey it's show time (Here we go now)

39
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:40,183
Now partying with (the ones that they)
Can open up their hearts with (Are you ready to dance?)

40
00:10:41,326 --> 00:10:44,643
Make some noise!
Show me what you got right here
Pump it up

41
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:47,853
Bring it on with the one you can trust from your heart

42
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,925
Leave it up to our music
Watch the light of sunrise with everyone

43
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:54,993
Make some noise!
Show me what you got right here

44
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:07,449
Ah! Awesome music can be heard from the woods once
Yeah, all people with different figures and thoughts

45
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:13,956
Get together and unite
Might as well wanna listen to a crazy track

46
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:19,011
So many hearts getting together to make one

47
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:25,707
We must never forget
That we are all being able to live (being able to live)

48
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:30,437
There are so many hearts in (many hearts in)
This world (this world)

49
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:36,335
That are important
This place is filled (filled) with thought!

50
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:42,385
Thoughts that brought friends (that brought friends)
Thoughts that brought bonds
Thoughts that brought trust together

51
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:55,468
When you do not notice this
You will for sure end up alone here
You will end up alone someday left behind

52
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:59,124
Yeah, power of life and death, life and death, yeah

53
00:12:59,184 --> 00:13:02,661
Power of life and death
What're you scared of?

54
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:11,695
Power of life and death, life and death, yeah
Power of life and death
What're you scared of?

55
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,987
Why not

56
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:25,348
Look hard at it

57
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:29,101
There are some that are already there
But some are still trying hard to succeed

58
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:34,279
Get down (get down)
Though it could be hard
I wanna be able to say

59
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:39,176
It all depends on you
Check out (check out)

60
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:49,534
Do you realize your mistakes?
Or do you just blame it on others?

61
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:54,178
Do you realize your mistakes?
Auh!

62
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:03,122
Don't blame others
(Don't) blame things
Stop being spoiled

63
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:06,298
And it makes you wanna achieve

64
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:10,683
The victory
Shake it (right now)
Success (success) (success)

65
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:15,858
Or failure is not decided (decided by dice)
It is you (who was born in this world, yeah)

66
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:18,941
Live or die (live or die)
Live or die all depends on you

67
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:22,677
Go for it, go for it
If you wanna live (all depends on you)
Pi ri pi pi

68
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:41,377
Life is fun (life is fun)
'Cause you blame all success and failure on yourself (on yourself)

69
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:47,342
Not, not, not having the power of life and death (life and death)
For yourself and keep relying on others

70
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:58,023
Won't satisfy (you when making a mistake)
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah
Do you realize your mistakes?

71
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:09,709
You are stupid
Don't blame it on someone

72
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:14,838
You know how stupid stu-tu-pid it's to blame it on other pe-people
Don't blame it on something

73
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:19,254
You know how stupid stupid stupid it's to blame it on things
Don't be a loser

74
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:41,788
All right everybody
Put your hands up and slap

75
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:45,289
The side of your ears
Just as you wake yourself up

76
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:50,712
All right everybody
Put your hands up and slap
I mean, everybody

Don't end up like shit pa, pa (yeah)

78
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:55,622
Success, failure (Success, failure, depends on yourself)

79
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:59,321
All depends on yourself
Stop being Wishy-Washy (ha, ha, everybody)

80
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:06,821
Don't you shit blame (Don't you shit the blame, commit to yourself)
Commit to yourself right here
At this spot, this spot, this spot
Cuz pain, bang!

81
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:30,893
Jokers speaking out
What they don't even think

82
00:16:30,953 --> 00:16:33,115
But I ain't got no words for you now

83
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:36,486
I can't be the one
One to tell you that things

84
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:38,891
Would turn out perfectly fine
Knowing it won't

85
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:44,884
Wooh (Stay natural)
Don't let me down cuz
I know you're alright

86
00:16:44,944 --> 00:16:49,957
Wooh (It's no big deal at all)
Don't be wishing things you can't

87
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:55,846
Ah, (ah)
Be honest to your instinct

88
00:16:55,906 --> 00:17:04,953
You as one
Unique and only
There is no need to change (Tell me ten good reasons why you have to change)

89
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:07,343
Ah (Get on the car right now and turn the key)

90
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:10,616
*Don't have to step on the break
Speed it up

91
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:13,175
*Disc goes round and round
As if on fast lane (Life will not gonna decelerate, why not take it)

92
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:15,357
Once you turn the key
Grab the handle

93
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:18,234
You are now
On your own
Where ever you go

94
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:21,066
Steer right left
Or go straight

95
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:23,747
Your choice is yourself

96
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,304
If you are stuck
Find whatever you like

97
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:29,663
And why not
Do all the things you can do

98
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:34,713
Ride across it
Ride it over

99
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:41,120
Ah, (ah)
Don't have to step on the break

100
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,883
Speed it up
Disc goes round and round
Like driving on fast lane

101
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:12,869
Spin the disc faster

102
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:16,539
Could you come out form the shade
Get under the sun

103
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:21,990
Try to seek for what you want to do
Wo-oh-oh

104
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,901
Scenery you've not yet discovered
Is all out there

105
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:27,802
Step on the peddle
Speed it up quicker

106
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:33,339
Run like the wind
No need to speed down
Wo-oh-oh

107
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:39,711
Do not care about other people
Who laughs at you and disrespects you

108
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:46,325
Is the choice you make
And your own aim
Wo-oh oh-oh-oh-oh

109
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:52,479
Wo-oh Wo-oh

110
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:04,798
Ooeeh
Turn and grab on to the steering wheel

111
00:19:11,896 --> 00:19:13,896
Keep going; speed it up
Have meters full

112
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:16,608
Let the engine roar like a mad beast
Get the gears heated

113
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:20,623
Accelerate

114
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:32,826
All right?
Dancing floor for you is ready

115
00:19:32,886 --> 00:19:36,082
Step on a step
Don't be so shy (so shy)

116
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:39,105
Carry on
Carry on

117
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:41,878
Dance with us!
Wo-o-o-oh

00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:44,835
Stomp hard on the beat
Let's start together

119
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:52,303
Dive into the bass drums you hear
This shit is still just a damn warm up you know, yeah!

120
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:58,312
Oh, let us get high now
Oh, let us get extremely high right now

121
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:14,640
"Damn it, damm it"
She is still not turning back to me today

122
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:21,645
I can never be honest to myself
I'm about to give it all up after all

123
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:27,316
The day I was waiting for (It's the day I was waiting for)
The moment suddenly appeared

124
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:32,752
When I stood on that low stage You were there in the front row of the crowd

125
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:38,838
All right
Dancing floor for you is ready

126
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:42,002
Step on a step
Don't be so shy (so shy)

127
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:44,694
Carry on

128
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:47,960
Dance with us!
Wo-o-o-oh

129
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,907
Stomp hard on the beat
Let's start together

130
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:58,326
I just want to see your biggest smile
Might seem like a dream but it ain't
It is here, yeah!

131
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:01,283
Yeah! Let us get high now

132
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:20,217
There are people inside (you just can't deal with)
So it ain't easy to gather hearts to one
Ah!

133
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:22,277
Fighting since monkeys

134
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:25,257
And probably will be the same now on

135
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:30,547
Still fighting just like the ancient days
We are still fighting from ages ago

136
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:47,144
Ah, ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta

137
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:52,105
But here, there is a drip of hope
We-we-we-we, we-we-weh

138
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:56,234
Making big noise
And we come along with the flow of the noise
And we can become one

139
00:21:56,294 --> 00:22:05,199
There is a small little hope
La-la-la-la, la-la-lah
"Dance tune it is"

140
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:23,387
We have been hitting the floor from the days we were born
Sound will keep changing
But what we do won't change

141
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:36,910
We have been hitting the floor from when we were born (It's all the same) It's all the same since we were apes (since we were apes)

142
00:24:45,257 --> 00:24:50,569
Was taking it for granted (yeah taking it for)
(The) day ends, then comes tomorrow 
(ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah comes tomorrow)

143
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:54,994
Oh, then comes the next day (then comes, yeah)
Spending the day (the day laughing, yeah laughing, yeah)

144
00:24:55,054 --> 00:24:58,089
Laughing with your crew
Talking so-and-so, was great (Hey yo so and so was great)

145
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:04,978
I've been living so far just for (the) heck of it (Here we go, 
so and so was great, so far so far just for the heck)
So there were things I could not notice (Come on)

146
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:07,429
The common days (days)
The common days (days days)

147
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:09,489
The usual days anybody would spend (anybody would spend, yeah)

148
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,238
Thought it would continue (days)
Thought it would continue (days days)

149
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:16,276
Never even thought about (the) fact that
 it would all end (It would all end someday)
Oh, someday (Someday I never was, yeah)

150
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:19,026
I never was bothered to face death in 
my life (Bothered to face death in my life)

151
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:23,386
Oh, oh, you should be able (Oh, you should be able)
Should be able (should be able)
Should be able to do that (should be able to do that, yeah)

152
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:27,007
End of life lead us to a part of nature (a part of nature)

153
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:32,655
Someday we won't be able to see each
other the next day, oh (Ah oh, ah oh, say good bye)

154
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:38,868
And cuz there are limits to time that (Alright alright limits to time)
Makes it meaningful

155
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:43,414
We can live now facing forward
If the final result is everything

156
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:46,480
We can say that people just come to life and die

157
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,392
But that's not right
What's important is how we spend a meaningful time now

158
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:55,867
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel and express one and two and three and go

159
00:25:55,927 --> 00:26:00,682
Live the limited time, say my name
Live the limited time, say my name
Let's go

160
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:04,287
End of life lead us to a part of nature (a part of nature)

161
00:26:04,347 --> 00:26:09,928
Someday we won't be able to see each 
other the next day, oh (Ah oh, ah oh say good bye)

162
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:16,123
And cuz there are limits to time that (Are limits, makes it meaningful wow)
Makes it meaningful

163
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:21,284
We can live now facing forward
We will eventually die and vanish

164
00:26:21,344 --> 00:26:28,749
Ending up as pieces of ash
Die, die, die

165
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:30,809
(We won't be able to shout out loud like this)

166
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:44,808
Won't be able to touch
There is no such thing as eternal youth and immortality

167
00:26:44,868 --> 00:26:51,652
All every single living thing that were born
In this world will absolutely die

168
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:58,960
The original tracks that constantly plays through the stereo

169
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,607
Sound that's very awesome
Sound that's very alright, that's right

170
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:06,254
Oh no, the messed up pool table
Oh yes, yummy brunch at twelve, oh

171
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:09,901
Kei taking off in the middle of the night
Our style of hip hop

172
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:17,074
Limited life and limited days
What do you intend to do within this time? Yeah

173
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:23,666
Limited life and limited days
Wanna make it a productive one

174
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:28,531
We will die (we will die)
We will disappear (we will disappear)

175
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:35,134
That is why today is great (that is why today is great)
You only live once no (you only live once no)

176
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:39,437
Choice but (choice but)
To keep moving on

177
00:27:39,497 --> 00:27:43,314
We will die (we will die)
We will disappear (we will disappear)

178
00:27:43,374 --> 00:27:50,296
That is why today is great (that is why today is great)
No other life than this (No other life than this)

179
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:55,145
This one (this one)
You only live once in forever

180
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:14,805
Find it out!

181
00:28:25,008 --> 00:28:32,804
Saying what we don't even intend, I was following your lead always

182
00:28:32,864 --> 00:28:45,843
Wanting people to think I really know everything
Saying things not even close to what I intend, oh yeah

183
00:28:45,903 --> 00:28:56,336
Not noticing, noticing, noticing the fact, realized (I could not really find out)
The value of, value of, value of my own life, you are (How can I save myself?)

184
00:28:56,488 --> 00:29:05,168
You are, oh oh (There should be a sense that only you feel)
What people think and feel shouldn't be 
all the same. Do (Feelings shouldn't be the same)

185
00:29:05,228 --> 00:29:09,229
Not stop (Do not stop to think)
To feel your will (and feel from your true)

186
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:15,176
Say your straight thoughts and feelings
 (feelings, yeah. Put your straight thoughts and feelings)
Into words and (into words and action. Don't you)

187
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,516
Go, oh (be so oh)
Don't be scared and just do it (and just do it)

188
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:39,689
Cutting out the bullshit, Fuck it up, saying bullshit you big Tumblebug
Cut out (the) bullshit, Fuck it up, saying bullshit you big Tumblebug

189
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:47,108
Uh, ah (But you)
There might be some moments you
 (will at no doubt lose yourself and others if you)

190
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:51,767
Ah (stop to think)
Have to follow people's way out (with your true thoughts, ...)

191
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:19,037
Pat it! Rally, rally! Such an... Pat it! Rally, rally! Such an...
Pat it! Rally, rally! Such an... Pat it! Rally, rally! Such an...

192
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:25,413
Won't say things outside my thoughts. Won't be flushed
Keep a strong will to fight yourself

193
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:32,395
Why not be yourself, why not be yourself, why not be yourself
Uh, oh!

194
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,685
Just know one thing
Don't lose yourself

195
00:30:34,745 --> 00:30:45,210
Everything is worth it all, saying this is for all lives
Be confident to have your own thoughts and to feel and (let) out your feeling

196
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:56,447
Why should there be true feelings you can't say?
We should be... We should be... We should be

197
00:30:56,507 --> 00:31:07,155
Only (what) you can feel oh (Yeah!)
You can find meanings to your existence

198
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:10,150
You liar
Stop saying bullshit

199
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:15,545
Look at my eyes and speak
Say what you think or else, you die

200
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:18,995
Oh, ah!

201
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:55,570
If we have different faces
So do we have different, different sense of values

202
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,875
Each person's perspective
Each person's stance

203
00:31:57,935 --> 00:32:00,208
Each person's sense of values
Take them in

204
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:05,365
Just how you and I are different
Each person in the world has what they wanna say
What they value

205
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:09,954
And what they don't care, they don't care, they don't care about
They are all totally different

206
00:32:10,152 --> 00:32:19,857
In this world that a lot of people live
If what you want is different

207
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,324
So is your sense of value
There may be things you just can't take in but what you gotta do

208
00:32:26,384 --> 00:32:29,097
First is to look straight towards

209
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:34,430
The person and understand
That's what's important, see?

210
00:32:36,146 --> 00:32:38,859
I've fallen in love with you
So I miss you

211
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:45,130
But I haven't told that to anyone yet
Never call me "Pop Star"

212
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:50,778
Actually that's not true
My heart is aching

213
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:05,005
Ouh!

214
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:29,093
I could never understand what he's saying
But it seems like everything makes sense to him
He brought 18 cream puffs again today

215
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:34,254
Yeah! How chaos this world is
In this world, oh

216
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,188
That a lot of people live, ah!

217
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,921
It means that there are that many different sense of values

218
00:33:44,395 --> 00:33:48,373
So let's try to understand each other

219
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:54,279
You pigs that are not trying to take each other in

220
00:33:54,339 --> 00:34:00,663
And just fighting
Stop the war!

221
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:15,790
You maggots!
Ah, ah, ah!

222
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:36,458
Oh, if we have different faces

223
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:41,484
So do we
So do we have different sense of values

224
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:48,139
We all live together if you cannot take others in
That is it, that is it

225
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:55,614
Try to understand lots and take
Lots and take them in
And take them in

226
00:34:55,674 --> 00:35:00,273
A chaotic world
There is no need of pointless dispute

227
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:11,142
The world you see
Will widen as you learn to take in
The different values

228
00:39:14,945 --> 00:39:19,532
I'm living (the) same boring shit everyday

229
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:25,341
Do you really think this is how you want?

230
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:32,208
We're all here 'cause we know what's fun and not

231
00:39:33,395 --> 00:39:39,098
You don't know anything so
Don't you dare give up!
Here we go!

232
00:39:51,679 --> 00:40:02,252
I got dumped the other day by my girl
But today I'll teach you all (the) fun stuff!

233
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:08,968
Change this floor to a dancing hall, boys and girls!

234
00:40:09,948 --> 00:40:15,039
Dance and make some noise!
Forget about everything!

235
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:18,697
Get fucked up (and) scream out with me!

236
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:21,677
Wo-o-o!
Wo-o-o!

237
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:26,951
Don't miss it!
(This) time is yours!

238
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,127
You guys ready?
Scream your ass out!

239
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,816
Wo-o-o!
Wo-o-o!

240
00:40:33,876 --> 00:40:39,188
I'll burst your brain in pieces

241
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:46,329
Close your eyes
Shake your fuckin' head

242
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:52,299
Don't think of anything
Emancipate

243
00:40:52,865 --> 00:41:05,785
The best moment tend to pass by quickly
That is how life is, life is, waah!

244
00:41:20,427 --> 00:41:23,945
Get fucked up (and) scream out with me!

245
00:41:24,005 --> 00:41:26,501
Wo-o-o!
Wo-o-o!

246
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:31,965
Don't miss it!
(This) time is yours!

247
00:41:32,953 --> 00:41:36,082
You guys ready?
Scream your ass out!

248
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:38,977
Wo-o-o!
Wo-o-o!

249
00:41:39,037 --> 00:41:44,153
I'll burst your brain in pieces

250
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:51,135
Wo-o-o!
Uh, uh, uh

251
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:16,333
Where do I go from here?
Now, where do I head for?

252
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:26,714
Which way oh is the right way?
Can't find out when you didn't even try

253
00:42:50,464 --> 00:42:59,962
What is really scary is
Not the road at night
Not even a wicked, ah

254
00:43:00,674 --> 00:43:10,151
It's yourself that cannot even feel a thing
After realizing you've lost the right way

255
00:43:10,993 --> 00:43:19,985
You wanna stay right?
Falling down is easier than what you think
Do you understand?

256
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:30,907
You have no choice but to take the hard way
If you want to stay truthful

257
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:39,734
Not easy to keep fighting for justice
Since you have to think and know what is right
Every night, every night

258
00:43:39,794 --> 00:43:51,401
You have to keep chasing the right answer (that) always changes so
Oh, every night, oh every night we'll chase

259
00:44:09,382 --> 00:44:14,786
It's hard to maintain what is right

260
00:44:29,794 --> 00:44:33,680
It might be easy if you stop thinking

261
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:44,146
But I do not think that the easy way (but I don't think that the easy way)
Is the way to happiness in this hard life
that we were all given (in this hard life that we were)

262
00:44:44,206 --> 00:44:53,888
Right way is what you think and find (think and find but I want)
But I want to choose (the) path and way of my happiness (my happiness)

263
00:44:53,948 --> 00:45:04,347
Though in hard waves; not losing, not losing the destination
I want to keep steering towards (the) way I believe (I believe)

264
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:11,854
It is hard to keep fighting (for) justice
Because you gotta think what is right
You gotta keep chasing

265
00:45:11,914 --> 00:45:20,201
The correct answer that always changes
(The correct answer that always changes)

266
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:31,201
Answers keep changing
We gotta keep thinking
To find the way we can stay right

267
00:49:26,914 --> 00:49:29,454
Come on ladies and gentlemen!

268
00:49:29,514 --> 00:49:32,434
Hey that's right!
Catch and set it now!

269
00:49:33,092 --> 00:49:36,334
This is what people call us
"Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas"

270
00:49:36,394 --> 00:49:39,583
Yes Sir!
Let's go for it and follow me!

271
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:46,646
Don't dirty your clothes with your drive! (auh)

272
00:50:00,924 --> 00:50:08,030
Do you feel the worth of your existence?
A question hits your mind on a depressed night

273
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:17,266
Have you ever thought oh if there are things that only you can do?
You are the only one!

274
00:50:18,062 --> 00:50:21,626
What is what you can do?
What thoughts you got now to do it? (Yeah! Do it!)

275
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:26,860
Don't wrap yourself inside a blanket you know
What is what you can do?

276
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,968
What thoughts you got now to do it? (Yeah! Do it!)
It ain't something you can achieve without trying (Without knowing)

277
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:38,468
That you are drowning down into the mud
Though you diss the ones
 (that have managed, managed to pull, pull, pull it off)

278
00:50:38,528 --> 00:50:41,998
You can't admit the fact of yourself
Being ah so cliche? (Watch out!)

279
00:50:42,058 --> 00:50:48,506
Hey stay in the crowd? (Destroy!)
Go out! Yo, come on now with your strong will!
Are you ready, guys?

280
00:50:48,566 --> 00:51:02,210
Find yourself your only self with your silent heart
You are always the only you that will never change as always

281
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:09,056
Wo-o-o-o-o! Wo-o-o-o-o!

282
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:16,222
There sure are things only you can do
Cuz you are the only one

283
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:23,848
Wo-o-o-o-o! Wo-o-o-o-o!

284
00:51:24,138 --> 00:51:32,010
The ones that don't even know left, right, or wrong will shine in life
Go find the meaning of yourself

285
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:35,542
Yeah!
Do you know your feelings？

286
00:51:35,832 --> 00:51:42,846
Your hearts will be harder to see as you keep living
At least let yourself believe yourself believing that

287
00:51:42,906 --> 00:51:46,470
You are the masterpiece God has made. Alright!
You wanna win this? (Ha!)
Like to be praised? (Ha!)

288
00:51:46,484 --> 00:51:49,956
Really like being praised? (Let's go!)
You are the best players

289
00:51:50,016 --> 00:51:53,948
Come on! Let's get it going on!
Yeah!

290
00:51:54,008 --> 00:51:56,008
So, so, so, so!

291
00:52:13,933 --> 00:52:19,422
Your hearts will be harder to see as you (keep) living
At least let yourself believe yourself

292
00:52:21,874 --> 00:52:28,106
Wo-o-o-o-o! Wo-o-o-o-o!

293
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:35,002
To live as yourself
It's actually like grabbing, like grabbing the sky

294
00:52:36,534 --> 00:52:43,042
Wo-o-o-o-o! Wo-o-o-o-o!

295
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:50,783
There are no insane circuits
So that you can move forward in your way, ah

296
00:52:50,843 --> 00:52:54,673
Ready! Run! Dance! Go!
Catch yourself meaning to your life

297
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:58,619
Think tell show
Cuz there are things only you can

298
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:12,579
The light will shine as you think your best is further
Wo-o-o! Wo-o-yeah!

299
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,847
Let's get fired up tonight

300
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:39,722
You need more than 6th sense
At least use thirteen to feel it

301
00:53:39,943 --> 00:53:41,989
Wake up!
Right now and burn it

302
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:44,509
Stand up!
Your heart is dancing

303
00:53:44,569 --> 00:53:49,720
Dance now!
More than yesterday
Throw that stone with full speed

304
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,980
It isn't easy
To link bonds with people

305
00:53:54,040 --> 00:54:00,939
To polish definite skills
To keep putting yourself into something
For the things you want

306
00:54:01,413 --> 00:54:06,019
It is something that people can not achieve easily, yeah

307
00:54:06,263 --> 00:54:10,034
That is why it's valuable
It's important

308
00:54:10,094 --> 00:54:13,152
To achieve something important
Is like building something little by little

309
00:54:13,212 --> 00:54:15,948
The strength to not lose against yourself, yourself
And the passion to not lose against others is needed

310
00:54:16,008 --> 00:54:22,508
It's something that people can't achieve easily
That is why, that is why it's worth it
Oi, oi!

311
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:39,271
It ain't something you can get in a day or two so
Skills (that) shakes people's hearts

312
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:43,217
It ain't something you can get in just a day or two so

313
00:54:44,427 --> 00:54:53,286
The trustable people that are always with you
The strong will of running towards your target

314
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:56,818
Do all you can do, ah

315
00:54:57,108 --> 00:55:00,419
Hybrid car
Like a hybrid car of heart and body

316
00:55:00,479 --> 00:55:03,019
This is how we function
It's no doubt for people

317
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:08,678
Who try to take the easy way out to be left behind
The course that awaits him is a sheer cliff

318
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:12,138
That's what I think, how about you?

319
00:55:18,063 --> 00:55:22,052
Don't wanna end up like him

320
00:55:22,335 --> 00:55:25,080
We are here! Stand up
And let's go ahead

321
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,876
Doesn't have to be cool
It can look bad

322
00:55:28,718 --> 00:55:30,879
We are here! Stand up
And let's go ahead

323
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:34,480
Cuz there is something to gain after the pains

324
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:53,372
The sweat you can feel
The troubled times

325
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:57,120
You spent will mean something to you, oh

326
00:55:57,735 --> 00:56:03,925
The important thing will be seen before what you crave for

327
00:56:04,832 --> 00:56:11,862
The important things
Aren't easy to gain

328
00:56:11,922 --> 00:56:19,442
But your efforts
But your efforts will bring them to you, oh

329
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:26,839
The irreplaceable things
Gain as much as you can

330
00:56:26,899 --> 00:56:31,439
What will be assets of your life

331
00:56:31,568 --> 00:56:35,806
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah
O-o-o-o-o-oh

332
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:46,238
The troubled times will have its meaning (its meaning)
What's important comes before what you crave

333
00:56:46,298 --> 00:56:51,405
Achieve as much as you can (as you can)
What will be the assets of your life

334
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:09,614
Ah!
Chase the light!

335
00:57:14,136 --> 00:57:20,161
I reached out but I have not arrived yet
I dislike nightly opinions

336
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:28,316
An impulse to make a convinient excuse
(From) time to time,

337
00:57:28,376 --> 00:57:35,577
I feel like running away
Trying to face away
from this situation

338
00:57:35,637 --> 00:57:40,673
But for me to live
I have to decide my own way

339
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:43,446
Take it easy
It's gonna be alright

340
00:57:43,654 --> 00:57:46,344
Have faith and
trust what a person you are

341
00:57:46,473 --> 00:57:48,795
In times when you feel lost
believe yourself

342
00:57:48,855 --> 00:57:51,267
Overcome all the enemies

343
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:56,652
Are you ready? Let's go!!

344
00:57:56,712 --> 00:57:59,302
Chill out
and be easygoing sometimes

345
00:57:59,362 --> 00:58:01,718
That was what you've
told me in bad times

346
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:07,182
Because I want to laugh when I was about to get entagled

347
00:58:07,242 --> 00:58:14,249
Also check daily days
I can not find it but I will keep my eyes away

348
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:24,595
I can do it
Stretch out your hand

349
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:50,948
Fog hanged over

350
00:58:51,003 --> 00:58:58,330
Making me blind(Making me blind)
I cut through the air
with my hand

351
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:03,818
And then I realized
I ran into a wonderland
filled with mysteries

352
00:59:03,878 --> 00:59:05,878
I knew if I kept
running without stopping

353
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:11,285
I will someday find the way
out from here

354
00:59:23,029 --> 00:59:25,765
Take a look around

355
00:59:38,647 --> 00:59:42,199
Each one of us shares
different thoughts and features

356
00:59:42,259 --> 00:59:51,174
No one is the same
and that's what makes us
the only special

357
00:59:55,453 --> 01:00:01,766
Spring has arrived
Season of new life has come

358
01:00:01,826 --> 01:00:08,545
So transparent and dazzling to tomorrow

359
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:15,297
We all face and go
through tough moments

360
01:00:15,357 --> 01:00:21,828
But with the help of others
we gain the power to
stand up again

361
01:03:20,513 --> 01:03:27,124
Have you ever found one that you just have to keep pursuing?
One, two, three, yeah

362
01:03:27,598 --> 01:03:31,301
A real dream never stops
Getting started

363
01:03:32,695 --> 01:03:37,856
She changed
Seems to have found a dream that she wants to fulfill

364
01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:46,267
Thought she would get bored of anything easily
But this time seems to be different oh (ooh-ru-ooh-ooh-eh)

365
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:52,147
I can see her going over her limits, oh
No matter how hard of a training

366
01:03:52,506 --> 01:03:57,914
It is or harsh words (it is or harsh words)
Yelled at I can see her, going beyond her borders (beyond borders)

367

Is one of a stunning thing to see

01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:33,910
Brings you a priceless time

Not enough with my family car

374
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:48,278
Though bad fuel efficiency
American cars are dreamy

375
01:04:48,568 --> 01:04:51,304
Private studio and a huge house

376
01:04:51,364 --> 01:04:54,905
Why (why) not (not) be greedy because (gay gay)

377

Have you ever thought?
What place do you want to be in the future?

Despite the harsh words and hard times
I can see her going over her limits, yeah

01:05:38,255 --> 01:05:41,175
Going over limits, over limits going over

I can see you (can see you)
Beyond your (beyond your)

A real dream never stops and (So you ever found one that you just have to keep pursuing?)

01:06:32,996 --> 01:06:42,632
Go and find a dream of your life
 Your life work

397
01:07:13,381 --> 01:07:16,278
I don't know what's being misunderstood

398
01:07:16,338 --> 01:07:19,672
Missiles flying
Children are getting shot

399
01:07:19,732 --> 01:07:21,571
Swindles everywhere

400
01:07:21,631 --> 01:07:22,941
People who should be

401
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:26,496
The most loved ones
Killing each other

402
01:07:26,556 --> 01:07:32,489
Once you keep an eye off
Things get stolen

403
01:07:33,354 --> 01:07:36,573
The world is like this. The world we don't know
The unknown world out of our hands

404
01:07:36,633 --> 01:07:40,243
It don't matter. Covering it up
Acting like you don't see anything

405
01:07:40,303 --> 01:07:43,269
If you think it's a different thing
You won't notice that the world

406
01:07:43,329 --> 01:07:46,870
You live in is eventually hitting towards this matter

407
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:52,633
Look at it!
Oh, yeah!

408
01:07:52,997 --> 01:07:56,331
The world is all linked together

409
01:07:56,414 --> 01:07:59,081
Save our loved ones and the world (Hey! Hey! Because breaking)

410
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:03,096
These peaceful days lasting is a wish (down the piled wood castle is easy)

411
01:08:03,156 --> 01:08:06,398
Because I have no idea (Hey! Hey! These peaceful days)

412
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:09,838
How many tickets to live today are left (continuing is just like a wish)

413
01:08:09,898 --> 01:08:13,939
Oh, even at the time when you were playing cards

414
01:08:13,999 --> 01:08:20,369
Somewhere in the world
Somebody is crying (ah, ah)

415
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,432
Us to one

416
01:08:34,494 --> 01:08:37,092
Let me hear your voice!
Oi! oi! oi! oi!...

417
01:08:54,843 --> 01:08:59,603
Ah, eah!

418
01:09:08,495 --> 01:09:12,105
We all have weaknesses
Losing against it is the end

419
01:09:14,948 --> 01:09:18,489
Don't limit yourself
Don't limit yourself, yeah!

420
01:09:18,549 --> 01:09:21,384
Got to change them!
Raise your voice
To fight it out against your weak self

421
01:09:21,444 --> 01:09:24,594
(We sure do gotta change theme, uh)

422
01:09:24,654 --> 01:09:26,401
We do gotta change theme

423
01:09:26,461 --> 01:09:29,634
The raising worries
The falling cold sweats on the back (on the back)

424
01:09:29,694 --> 01:09:32,867
Backing off saying
"Can not make it happen" (breakin' down)

425
01:09:32,927 --> 01:09:36,315
You really think (that way)?
You really think (that way)?

426
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:39,962
Shake it off and move on (come on!)
Shake it off and move on

427
01:09:40,367 --> 01:09:43,954
Just you are my love
Your pure feeling (you are my love, your faithful eyes)

428
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:47,838
Your beautiful voice
It's so valuable (your beautiful voice, it's so precious)

429
01:09:47,898 --> 01:09:53,753
I wanna stay with you Not only tonight, uh
(I want to stay with you, not only tonight but from now on)

430
01:09:53,813 --> 01:10:01,034
The words that fell from you (the words that fell from your voice)
Let us change it to connect tomorrow (change it to connect tomorrow)

431
01:10:01,094 --> 01:10:06,774
Let's sing until our voices die
Oh, there must be many walls

432
01:10:06,977 --> 01:10:08,977
There must be times you will be breaking down

433
01:10:09,336 --> 01:10:12,187
But this song is there for you

434
01:13:27,354 --> 01:13:30,860
He said, "If you wanna talk about your ideal

435
01:13:30,943 --> 01:13:37,579
You need power that corresponds with it"
Not even having an ideal to talk about

436
01:13:37,882 --> 01:13:40,421
That day, I just gave it up

437
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:46,686
But seeing people living hard, getting heat from their ambitions
Can't stay as who I am now who can't think of

438
01:13:46,746 --> 01:13:54,404
A sin-sin-sin-sin-single thing to win
Time to move now

439
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:58,534
I want to achieve it, that is why I have to

440
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:01,467
Do what it takes with this hand, changing

441
01:14:01,527 --> 01:14:05,137
The length of this feelings to the amount of heat

442
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:07,868
I'm gonna achieve it regardless of its size

443
01:14:07,928 --> 01:14:12,757
I want to achieve it, I want to achieve it, I want to achieve it

444
01:14:12,817 --> 01:14:17,232
Changing the length of this feelings to the amount of heat

445
01:14:17,292 --> 01:14:20,718
I'm gonna achieve it no matter how big it is

446
01:14:35,078 --> 01:14:39,412
You done already？
Don't you wanna win what you hoped for with your own hands？

447
01:14:39,495 --> 01:14:43,914
Then go for it with your strong heart and show it to me right here
You pigs

448
01:14:48,689 --> 01:14:52,437
If you can't, then we're done talking
If you can't, then we're done talking

449
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:56,903
Alright, do your best and cry out loud, you pigs! Yeah

450
01:14:56,986 --> 01:15:01,171
Don't you stop even if you cannot see what is in front of you
If you can't, then we are done talking

451
01:15:01,231 --> 01:15:09,533
Do your best and cry out loud, keep the heat and fire yourself up
Keep on going single minded

452
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:11,593
You done already?

453
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,636
Seeing people filled with ambition

454
01:15:28,696 --> 01:15:32,710
Getting heat from the power to achieve something big
Can't stay as who I am now

455
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:41,279
Who can't think of a single, single, single thing to win
Time to move now

456
01:15:46,868 --> 01:15:53,188
I want to achieve it, so whatever it takes
What's needed is to try hard with my hands

457
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:58,882
I want to achieve it, so whatever it takes
To get one in this hand

458
01:15:59,241 --> 01:16:02,907
I believe (to achieve a big one)

459
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:05,764
That is where (you need to put that much guts into it)

460
01:16:05,824 --> 01:16:13,850
You can find (a big foot print to this generation)
What's really worth (let us stomp it, yeah)

461
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:26,674
You guys do not notice that we

462
01:16:26,734 --> 01:16:29,677
Are gifted just by being humans

463
01:16:29,714 --> 01:16:32,969
We are absolute predators

464
01:16:33,052 --> 01:16:36,981
We do not even have any enemies

465
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:40,225
Maybe there are other animals watching us

466
01:16:40,317 --> 01:16:49,227
And thinking that someday "we will beat them down"

467
01:16:55,204 --> 01:16:57,772
Oh we have the brains to think hard

468
01:16:57,954 --> 01:17:00,562
Wear our favorite clothes

469
01:17:00,737 --> 01:17:04,633
We are at no doubt human beings

470
01:17:04,623 --> 01:17:07,356
Many small lives
They were born

471
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:08,829
with the fate

472
01:17:08,914 --> 01:17:10,914
of dying for someone

473
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,961
A human baby

474
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:16,813
When will they find out

475
01:17:16,919 --> 01:17:20,751
That at the point they were born, we are

476
01:17:20,857 --> 01:17:23,954
(The) winners of Earth

477
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:35,287
"Hey, why are you crying?" I ask you, next to me

478
01:17:35,436 --> 01:17:43,055
That's why we live so close together, until we shine
For what have I been living for?

479
01:17:43,138 --> 01:17:48,331
When will I find out the answer? 
An answer that is only for you

480
01:17:48,598 --> 01:17:52,757
What will myself and (the) first scenery I saw

481
01:17:53,268 --> 01:18:00,679
Look like? 
It's my face, my face

482
01:18:03,821 --> 01:18:04,651
Shut up!

483
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:07,855
I read this inside the book I read before

484
01:18:07,918 --> 01:18:09,918
[The book I read before] 
According (to) Maslow

485
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:10,751
[According (to) Maslow]

486
01:18:10,788 --> 01:18:13,790
There are five steps (in a) human's desire

487
01:18:13,896 --> 01:18:16,934
To live a long life to stay safe and to receive

488
01:18:17,017 --> 01:18:19,502
[Baby] 
love from others

489
01:18:19,631 --> 01:18:21,470
To get respect from 
[Baby]

490
01:18:21,576 --> 01:18:23,586
other, To get closer 
[Yeah]

491
01:18:23,646 --> 01:18:25,531
to your ideal 
[Yeah]

492
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:27,129
That's what it said 
[Yeah]

493
01:18:27,373 --> 01:18:30,622
No matter how hard other animals try

494
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:34,471
they probably can't go over the first step

495
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:38,510
That is how intelligent we are and, (an animal) filled with greed

496
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:52,466
But that is probably why we can still live on top of the food chain

497
01:18:52,503 --> 01:18:55,002
in this blue planet although we have weak bodies

498
01:18:57,434 --> 01:19:07,779
Ah, the usual morning reflected in your eyes

499
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:14,136
Is disappearing in the tears flowing from them

500
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:21,097
For what to live for 
Think deeply as you live yeah

501
01:19:21,387 --> 01:19:29,451
Cuz humans are (the) only ones that can do this on Earth 
Your new answer,

502
01:19:32,197 --> 01:19:38,343
What is it that you want to get in your right hands? 
Let me hear

503
01:19:39,435 --> 01:19:41,585
Tell me your new answer 
Prove that you are different from monkeys

504
01:19:41,686 --> 01:19:44,231
If there is nothing to crave for, humans will die in a way

505
01:19:44,291 --> 01:19:53,227
Don't you think so too? 
Let me hear, Let me hear, Let me hear

506
01:22:51,072 --> 01:22:53,727
The old way I saw in my dream

507
01:22:54,109 --> 01:22:59,329
The kids talking about what to do now
With shining eyes

508
01:22:59,389 --> 01:23:03,712
Closing my eyes
I am alone in the coldness

509
01:23:04,623 --> 01:23:08,585
Ah-ah!
Feeling really down

510
01:23:08,645 --> 01:23:11,795
Ah-ah-ah-ah!
Losing all the meaning to live

511
01:23:11,855 --> 01:23:15,442
E-yeah!
Knowing it's not right

512
01:23:15,502 --> 01:23:19,641
Oh-oh-oh!
Can't put my energy against it

513
01:23:19,701 --> 01:23:22,871
The cold winter has passed by

514
01:23:23,529 --> 01:23:26,978
Come on! Let us go to
Come on! Let us go to

515
01:23:27,187 --> 01:23:30,406
The school route filled with cherry blossoms

516
01:23:30,466 --> 01:23:34,056
A place kids are still hanging out, yeah

517
01:23:34,116 --> 01:23:41,110
Before it's over
Dance like those petals waving in the breeze

518
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:46,022
Free your frozen self seized in fear

519
01:23:48,405 --> 01:23:52,268
You know the view of the cherry blossoms
(The scene of the cherry blossoms)

520
01:23:52,328 --> 01:23:59,848
Let me send you the view along with my voice
(Let me send the scene to you)

521
01:23:59,931 --> 01:24:06,805
Take the memory to heart, and let's face (em)
All tomorrow, don't worry

522
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,721
There should be means to the place
You were raised, and the people

523
01:24:19,781 --> 01:24:23,230
You met there
It really means a lot to me

524
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:26,417
Where are we heading towards?

525
01:24:26,477 --> 01:24:30,639
What are we going to live and die for?

526
01:24:30,814 --> 01:24:38,454
Reflecting on the tears, efforts, and regrets
Find the answer, if we live our lives today (to)

527
01:24:39,411 --> 01:24:40,744
The best

528
01:24:47,267 --> 01:24:52,677
The light pink petals
Don't you wanna flutter big if you're eventually

529
01:24:52,737 --> 01:24:54,122
Gonna scatter apart?

530
01:25:14,035 --> 01:25:18,369
For it is over
(We have to step hard)

531
01:25:18,383 --> 01:25:21,689
Achieve the power to beat yourself

532
01:25:22,002 --> 01:25:28,322
Come on, here, grab this hand
Everyone is scared

533
01:25:29,808 --> 01:25:38,318
(Everyone is scared, everyone is a coward, so let us step now)
So let us step on the steps together

534
01:25:38,378 --> 01:25:41,252
Starting slowly tonight

535
01:25:42,485 --> 01:25:44,784
And at last, dance hard

536
01:26:22,104 --> 01:26:25,538
Is that all you have got?
Yeah, it's quite tough, though

537
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:27,390
One more try
Not easy

538
01:26:27,404 --> 01:26:29,404
Alright If you're

539
01:26:29,659 --> 01:26:33,119
Ok with that
Who you think I am?

540
01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:34,945
Ready go!
Ready go!

541
01:26:35,005 --> 01:26:44,021
Say good bye to yourself
Feels like running away uh, oh oh

542
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:51,532
When the one last step is heavy, oh oh

543
01:26:51,592 --> 01:26:54,259
Hey yo!
That's when you go for it

544
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:55,997
Say good bye to yourself

545
01:26:56,057 --> 01:26:59,823
Who feels like running away at hard times

546
01:26:59,883 --> 01:27:03,424
When the one last step is dramatically heavy

547
01:27:03,622 --> 01:27:05,944
That is when you go for it

548
01:27:06,257 --> 01:27:12,196
"Go beyond your limits"
That's what they say

549
01:27:12,532 --> 01:27:14,256
Can't do it, oh

550
01:27:14,753 --> 01:27:17,834
At hard times
When I wanna cry

551
01:27:17,894 --> 01:27:21,987
Don't wanna
Don't wanna give it up no more

552
01:27:22,139 --> 01:27:27,359
If the hardest last step
Is the step that will change you

553
01:27:27,419 --> 01:27:31,075
Then do what ever you can do
Take the step

554
01:27:53,923 --> 01:27:56,646
It's not only you who is thrown into a battlefield

555
01:27:56,706 --> 01:27:58,039
That goes for everybody

556
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:04,517
Everyone living are fighting just like this
I myself will keep fighting, fighting, fighting as well

557
01:28:09,016 --> 01:28:11,683
Yeah! Filled with frustration

558
01:28:11,743 --> 01:28:17,040
Can't help gnashing your teeth every night
Though you've lost your 10 out of 14

559
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,238
Of your top teeth!

560
01:28:19,367 --> 01:28:24,274
Oh, one thing I am glad to have realized
Is the fact that

561
01:28:24,656 --> 01:28:29,465
Oh, everyone is here with me
It means I don't have to keep

562
01:28:29,525 --> 01:28:34,492
Fighting by myself
The fact that everyone (everyone)

563
01:28:34,552 --> 01:28:39,836
Living in the same generation is standing pain (standing pain)

564
01:28:39,896 --> 01:28:44,771
And in the same battlefield (oh, oh, oh, oh)

565
01:28:44,831 --> 01:28:49,134
It probably means a lot

566
01:28:49,194 --> 01:28:54,138
To take the most painful step, painful step, painful step

567
01:28:54,198 --> 01:29:00,706
Which your legs are about to tear off
Everyone living are fighting

568
01:29:00,766 --> 01:29:03,847
Just like this
I myself will keep

569
01:29:03,907 --> 01:29:12,266
I myself will keep fighting as well
Let's go beyond our borders

570
01:30:00,865 --> 01:30:04,624
Stand up!

571
01:30:15,978 --> 01:30:21,106
Why we standing here

572
01:30:21,258 --> 01:30:26,524
In such lonely world filled with silence?

573
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:33,069
Why is world so cold?

574
01:30:33,129 --> 01:30:36,716
We're iced on the ground, can't move

575
01:30:42,595 --> 01:30:48,896
(Now it is time for me to carry out the promise
The light of hope suddenly shined)

576
01:30:48,956 --> 01:30:52,911
We feel the power flowing through us

577
01:30:52,971 --> 01:30:56,213
<i>(Don't be so scared)</i>
Why are we so scared?

578
01:30:56,589 --> 01:31:02,625
We're not alone <i>(We are not alone)</i>
Free your emotions and

579
01:31:02,662 --> 01:31:10,251
scream from your heart <i>(Scream from your heart)</i>
It rouses now, feel that you're alive

580
01:31:23,165 --> 01:31:29,224
Sorry to have you waiting for so long...

581
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:35,470
Would this feeling reach your <i>heart?</i>

582
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:45,489
(Our heart has been united as one No one can stop us)
This is <i>our destiny!</i>

583
01:31:45,572 --> 01:31:49,279
We feel the power flowing through us
<i>(Don't be so scared)</i>

584
01:31:49,316 --> 01:31:52,414
<i>(Don't be so scared)</i>
Why are we so scared?

585
01:31:53,026 --> 01:32:00,666
We're not alone <i>(We are not alone)</i>
Free your emotions and scream from your heart

586
01:32:00,726 --> 01:32:06,284
<i>(Scream from your heart)</i>
It rouses now, feel that you're alive!

587
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,524
Road stretches to all directions

588
01:33:57,653 --> 01:34:01,746
North, East, and South, West
It goes on and on and forever

589
01:34:01,806 --> 01:34:06,016
Simple but yet complicated
Tangles and untangles

590
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:08,490
Life is like a walkway

591
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:13,779
It goes awfully smooth sometimes but goes tough

592
01:34:13,839 --> 01:34:18,886
Just like how a road goes up and down, right and left

593
01:34:36,426 --> 01:34:40,036
Life goes on in different directions

594
01:34:40,096 --> 01:34:42,648
Stretches perfectly straight
Crosses over in time to time

595
01:34:42,754 --> 01:34:46,652
Signals guides us what to do and not to
But there aren't signals in our life

596
01:34:46,689 --> 01:34:56,923
It's up to us to discover as an individual man
What is right and wrong (in course of life)

597
01:35:06,581 --> 01:35:10,007
There is nothing called short cuts in our life

598
01:35:10,067 --> 01:35:17,633
It's the small steps that pile up
And makes us a better man

599
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:30,378
You can walk towards left, right, or straight
You can walk anywhere anytime

600
01:35:30,438 --> 01:35:36,343
But not backwards

601
01:35:40,957 --> 01:35:44,968
Eeeeh, Ahhh!

602
01:35:48,547 --> 01:35:52,807
Aaaah, Ohhh!

603
01:35:53,853 --> 01:35:55,853
Ahhh, uah!

604
01:36:10,632 --> 01:36:16,148
On a crossroad
We tend to bump into each other

605
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:18,489
Fight, fight, fight with many people

606
01:36:18,549 --> 01:36:21,285
Laps, laps, laps over many roads

607
01:36:21,345 --> 01:36:23,345
Just keep walking

608
01:36:23,842 --> 01:36:29,108
If you don't stop someday we
Will, will will achieve what we've aimed

609
01:36:29,168 --> 01:36:31,398
Take, take, take the upcoming chance

610
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:33,458
So we go

611
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:37,375
Life and road in many ways (ta-ta-ta)

612
01:36:37,435 --> 01:36:39,578
Interacting with others

613
01:36:39,638 --> 01:36:42,558
Laughing, fighting, and crying
We crossover (ta-ta-ta)

614
01:36:50,897 --> 01:36:53,242
Ah, ta-ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta, ouaah

615
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,123
Closely listen to the voice and heart beat

616
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:27,177
Now the beating has stopped can’t hear a thing
Pieces has fell apart

617
01:37:42,909 --> 01:37:46,919
The world we live today is filled with gloom and tears

618
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:52,179
But what we only can do is to sigh and site alone in the dark

619
01:37:52,856 --> 01:37:56,291
Life filled with vanity
Colors have faded

620
01:37:56,351 --> 01:37:59,360
Things you desire exist here

621
01:38:01,241 --> 01:38:07,361
Flee from this colorless world
Back in the days everything had shined so bright

622
01:38:07,421 --> 01:38:13,082
We didn’t have to carry fear towards future
Dreams colored (and) lit our mind with hope

623
01:38:13,342 --> 01:38:20,126
The sound of heart we shared
Beats in my memory unchanged from back then

624
01:38:20,347 --> 01:38:25,648
Can you hear me sing?
Don’t you be fall in down

625
01:38:25,809 --> 01:38:28,486
Oh, my Lord, it’s gone
What should I do?

626
01:38:28,546 --> 01:38:30,818
Pieces I had
Have fell apart

627
01:38:30,878 --> 01:38:33,081
Where do you belong?
Where should I aim (for)?

628
01:38:33,141 --> 01:38:36,021
Once you’ve lost sight
It’s left to fall apart

629
01:38:48,769 --> 01:38:52,043
Let’s start it over again

630
01:38:52,903 --> 01:38:55,826
Rebuild and combine all the pieces we have lost

631
01:38:55,886 --> 01:38:58,269
To become one
Like a puzzle

632
01:38:58,329 --> 01:39:00,773
Take it one at a time

633
01:39:10,373 --> 01:39:13,082
When I stopped a rusted chain tangled me up

634
01:39:13,142 --> 01:39:15,425
Tying my body onto the ground

635
01:39:15,485 --> 01:39:17,882
As I sink underground I call your name

636
01:39:17,942 --> 01:39:22,355
What can I do to see the day light once more?
Tear it apart and rip it off

637
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:24,415
Break the chain now
Sink down or swim up

638
01:39:24,475 --> 01:39:25,776
Fight your way through

639
01:39:25,836 --> 01:39:31,278
Seek your way out
If you can not, you are left to drown deep inside
Chain tangled me harder, choking my neck

640
01:39:41,414 --> 01:39:44,046
You who knew all my weakness is gone

641
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:46,400
Can you come back and stay by my side

642
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:52,107
I’ll be standing here waiting you

643
01:39:53,027 --> 01:39:58,629
Heart newly born is always strong and brave

644
01:39:58,689 --> 01:40:04,404
No matter how steep the road we take
It can drive us forever and ever
Let’s take it how we want

645
01:40:04,464 --> 01:40:14,548
The choice we make is (for you) and my future
Can you hear me sing?

646
01:40:27,436 --> 01:40:29,592
Misery is nothing

647
01:40:29,652 --> 01:40:31,889
It is all up to your thoughts and beliefs

648
01:40:32,449 --> 01:40:37,065
To bring in success within your life
Don't you compare yourself with other people

649
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:43,217
That's a waste of person you are, so why not be honest to your emotion?

650
01:40:43,297 --> 01:40:44,654
Don’t you be falling down

651
01:40:44,714 --> 01:40:49,129
All the promises made between us
Broke in pieces and turned into sand

652
01:40:49,189 --> 01:40:54,849
Let's escape from this colorless world to find myself
And tomorrow that we live

653
01:43:17,610 --> 01:43:21,471
Shake it down
We have confidence to make
You guys guys you guys enjoy

654
01:43:21,531 --> 01:43:25,715
For this day, we have worked so hard
Nobody can stop
No one can stop us

655
01:43:25,775 --> 01:43:28,959

All say (we) are the number one! ah!

Your bodies will move once you hear our sound
This place will soon turn into turn into mad(ness)

So we're gonna do it

686
01:45:42,141 --> 01:45:45,791

Ah, ah
We are made from the decisions we make

697
01:47:42,817 --> 01:47:49,493
Ourselves right now are at the top of the road we have come through

698
01:47:49,553 --> 01:47:55,825
The road that you chose has lead you to yourself; what you are

699
01:48:25,932 --> 01:48:30,252
Though the road of decision may be a tough one

700
01:48:30,312 --> 01:48:35,841
Don't you have an ideal self? Ideal self?  
Hang tight and pick it out

Ah, ah
We are made from the decisions we make

704
01:48:55,780 --> 01:49:02,938
Ourselves right now are at the top of the road we have come through

705
01:49:03,315 --> 01:49:09,054
The steps have made you what you are

706
01:49:12,953 --> 01:49:16,221
Pick it out with guts
The road may be steep but

707
01:49:26,612 --> 01:49:31,917

You'll see change from what you were before

709
01:49:48,389 --> 01:49:51,441
You might be running away at last

710
01:49:51,501 --> 01:49:58,309
Making excuses
You might just be acting as if you've made the best decision

711
01:49:58,395 --> 01:50:04,667
There are days when you get lost, ah

712
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:08,795
Always being confronted with the questions

713
01:50:08,855 --> 01:50:11,790
"How do you wanna proceed?"
"What do you wanna do?"

714
01:50:11,850 --> 01:50:18,843
Can you do it? To walk this uneasy road
Show it to me now, do it right now

715
01:50:18,903 --> 01:50:21,987
Yeah!

716
01:50:22,784 --> 01:50:24,567
Go over this tough steep road

717
01:50:24,592 --> 01:50:28,552
Because the future you hope for is there
Have the strong heart.

718
01:50:28,612 --> 01:50:32,688
The strong will to choose the road that you will need courage to

719
01:50:32,748 --> 01:50:36,148
Ah

720
01:50:36,208 --> 01:50:39,827
Pick it out with courage
The road may be steep but

01:50:39,887 --> 01:50:44,490
Oh
We're made from the decisions we make (oh)

722
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:49,488

You might just be acting as if you've made the best decisions

723
01:50:49,548 --> 01:50:56,155
Though it may seem like a steep and tough road, oh

724
01:50:56,215 --> 01:51:02,676
I believe there will be another new dawn in front of me

725
01:51:03,237 --> 01:51:09,956
I want to witness the awesome morning glow

726
01:51:10,049 --> 01:51:17,874
In which we can say everything was worth it
Ah!

727
01:51:17,934 --> 01:51:22,588
There are lots of decisions we have to make as we live
